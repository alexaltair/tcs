This is a machine learning / genetic algorithms project I originally proposed [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/iwa/replicating_douglas_lenats_traveller_tcs_win_with/).

I'm currently still in the "translate Traveller's rules into Ruby code" stage. The machine learning stage will come later.

I plan to write the code in a way that assumes the rules of the original 1981 tournament, which stated:

>The maximum allowed tech level for all ships is 12. The total pilot allowance for the squadron is 200. The squadron must be capable of jump-3; each ship and small craft must be capable of 1-G acceleration. The squadron must be capable of gas giant refueling.
